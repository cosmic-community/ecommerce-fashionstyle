## üìù Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Design and develop a full-stack e-commerce website for selling clothes, using technologies like React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database (or suggest alternatives if better suited). Prioritize a perfect, modern UI/UX with intuitive navigation, smooth animations, and responsive design across devices. Use a carefully curated color palette (e.g., soft blues/greens for trust, neutrals for balance, and vibrant accents for interactions) to create visual harmony and accessibility (WCAG compliant). Implement both dark and light modes with seamless toggling, automatic detection via user/system preferences, and consistent theming throughout.
>
> The site should include:
>
> - **Admin Panel**: A secure dashboard where admins can control all aspects of the website, including adding/editing/deleting products, managing users, moderating posts and comments, setting discounts with expiration dates, viewing analytics, and handling orders.
>
> - **User Authentication**: A login page for customers with email/password authentication, plus a registration form for new users. Include password recovery and session management for security.
>
> - **Feed Section**: A social-style feed displaying posts of products shared by all customers. Each post shows the product details, and users can react (e.g., like/heart), comment, and perform CRUD operations (create new posts, read/view, update/edit their own, delete their own). Admins can moderate all.
>
> - **Top Liked Section**: A dedicated page or widget showing the most reacted/liked posts from the feed, sorted by reaction count in descending order, updated in real-time or on refresh.
>
> - **Try-On Feature**: An important interactive section where users can open their device's camera, select clothes from the catalog, and use augmented reality (AR) to virtually try them on. The system should overlay the clothing on the user's live camera feed to check fit, size, and style. Integrate libraries like AR.js or similar for this.
>
> - **Product Management**: Products are added via the admin panel with details like name, attributes (e.g., size, color, material), original price, and optional discount (with start/end dates). During the discount period, display the discounted price; after expiration, automatically revert to the original price.
>
> - **Checkout Page**: A secure page for purchasing, where users select product attributes (e.g., size/color), choose quantity, view total (including any discounts), add to cart, and proceed to payment. Handle cart persistence for logged-in users.
>
> - **Product Reviews and Ratings**: Allow customers to leave star ratings (1-5), written reviews, and upload photos of themselves wearing the clothes on product pages. This builds trust and helps with decision-making; admins can moderate reviews.
>
> - **Wishlist Feature**: Logged-in users can add products to a personal wishlist for later viewing or purchase, accessible from their profile.
>
> - **Search Bar**: A global search function on the site to quickly find products, posts, or categories by keywords, attributes (e.g., size, color), or other filters.
>
> - **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the entire website is fully optimized for mobile devices, with responsive design, easy navigation, and touch-friendly elements to support features like camera try-on.
>
> - **Social Media Sharing**: Include buttons on product pages and feed posts to share content directly to platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or X (Twitter) for increased visibility.
>
> - **Size Guide**: A dedicated page or popup with measurement charts, body type tips, and sizing recommendations to help customers select the right fit, integrated with product pages.
>
> - **Personalized Recommendations**: Display suggested products based on user browsing history, past purchases, or feed interactions, using simple algorithms like collaborative filtering.
>
> Ensure the site is user-friendly, with secure data handling (e.g., HTTPS), basic SEO, and a focus on modern aesthetics. Provide the full source code, database schema, and deployment instructions."
